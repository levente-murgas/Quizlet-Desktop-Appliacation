Description:

When learning a new language, it can be hard to remember all the new vocabulary, which is exactly where flashcards can help.
Typically, flashcards show a hint (a task or a picture) on one side and the right answer on the other. Flashcards can be used to remember any sort of data.
In this application, you are able to create flashcards for any data you want to memorize. By arranging your data into study sets, you are also able to categorize all your cards (i.e: Animals, Tools, Food).
If you're done with creating your study set, you can go ahead and start learning with the "Study" function!
